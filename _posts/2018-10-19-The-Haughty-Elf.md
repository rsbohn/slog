The elf arrived later that day. He had long blond hair and was dressed
in silky robes. Typical elf I guess.

The minute he saw the steel helm studded with emeralds his 
eyes bulged. "I must have it!" he shouted.

Jonny haggled with the elf, settling on a price that was somewhat
generous, on the part of the elf. The elf put on the helm
and went strutting out.

Of course that was Phil, pretending to be a rather gaudy helm.
I wonder what adventures he and the elf will have...
